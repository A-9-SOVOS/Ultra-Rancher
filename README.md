# Ultra-Rancher
A game where you train and proliferate fighting creatures.

Roadmap:
0.01 Develop a platform agnostic avant garde engine for projecting 2d sprites with transparency into sudo 3d space with forced perspective/practical effect trickery
0.02 Work out a control system that moves a 2d world around you to create the illusion of a 3d world rather than moving you through a 3d world {QWEASD}
0.03 Develop point and click interactions so sprites can be clicked to trigger scripts
0.04 testing
0.05 Develop the combat system
0.06 add conversion/conversation to combat
0.07 Develop the reproductive system
0.08 start on the beastiary and inventory
0.09 start building the world and main story
0.10 playable demo
